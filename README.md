# Learn Bevy's ECS by ripping off somebody else's project (Book source)

This is the repository for the source of my mini-book on learning Bevy's ECS, based on the book/project [Hands-on Rust: Effective Learning through 2D Game Development and Play](https://pragprog.com/titles/hwrust/hands-on-rust); it's hosted on GitHub pages, and can be read [here](https://saveriomiroddi.github.io/learn_bevy_ecs_by_ripping_off).
