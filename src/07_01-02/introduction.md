# Introduction to steps 07.01-02

This chapter covers both steps 07.01 and 07.02; we're going to explore `State`s, `SystemSet`s and `Stage`s (and the `iyes_loopless` crate).

The Bevy concepts described here are the foundation for structuring games, and this step is the one that departs the most from the source project.

The directory names are `07_TurnBasedGames_01_wandering` and `07_TurnBasedGames_02_turnbased`.
